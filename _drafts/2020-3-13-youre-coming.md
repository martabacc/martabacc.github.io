I know you're coming. I can feel you in the wind, touch you in my fingertips. Your footsteps getting louder.

Your shadow getting significant, a hand in the mid air about to knock my door.

I'm working on my end, dear. About to find my sweet spot along with you in it. Not yet, but I can see it nearby.

I do not acknowledge your existence - I choose not to. I'm aware you're about to grip me tight in the near future, latching with my ankles. My decisions, my thoughts, my questions, and the answers that follow, brings you closer. 
    
I always deny your existence. I brushed your presence off. And I'll always do, regardless.
