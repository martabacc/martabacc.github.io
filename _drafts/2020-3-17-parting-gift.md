the sound of clacking glass. wrapped in a peach cloth, the table somehow matched our wardrobe. Wonderful evening.

"is everything okay?"

"I guess", swirling my drink for times.

"...*wrong answer*"

"hmm, *in vino veritas*, isn't it?"

replied with a smile.

"no I can't", I said, "I have quitted"

"even for this once?"

"yes. I'll have water please", signalling the waitress.

"I want to bring up something", and me coughing softly. During this covid-19 outbreak, it's not elegant move. The topic I'm about to bring is a bit heavy and I need to clear some breath out.

"I'm all ears"

"This is the time we should part ways."

"... why? all of a sudden?"

"yes"

"is something wrong?"

"no, dear, everything's perfect"

"is it me?"

"no, you're more than I will ever deserve"

"I do not understand."

"So do I, dear. That's why I have to end this. I think it's me."

"what's wrong with you?"

"...damaged find damaged. And I don't find you damaged at all. I don't think we connect on a level a pair should be"

the face of disappointment, disapproval, and confused. The face I'm familiar with. I saw them everytime I try to digest these thoughts, and I still do not understand. I'm not good with unknowns.

"so, you feel that you unworthy of me?"

"yes"

"you don't have feelings for me?"

"I have. A strong one. But ... I do not indulge myself in pleasure, dear."

"that's a compliment, but you're insinuating quite the opposite"

"I know."

silence fills the room of us for a while.

"I guess I know how should you address the feeling you have right now. The unworthy feeling."

"what's that?"

"it's a mantra"

"yes?"

"aight. Speak your thoughts, but now end it with `and I'm okay with that`"

hmm, that's quite new, and interesting. I'll bite.

So I'm feeling bad about lying to you, hiding things I shouldn't have. I don't even know why I did that, dishonesty is not my forte. I'm afraid that you'll leave once you find out, so I'm thinking to stop it for good, I'll leave first. I feel unworthy of your kindness, your warmth, your care, the good feelings... I'm not used to it. I've been away from it all from a very long time and it feel uncomfortable to have them back. I may or may not get used to it, who knows. *And I'm okay with that*.

"No, that doesn't rhyme well.", as I continue.

"I want you to know, that nothing is less from you. You're a whole, everything this world could pack its perfection into. I do not deserve you. I feel enormous debt in my shoulder whenever I'm with you, being unworthy and having it in my palm suffocates me. I'm sorry, but I cannot continue us. It should end. It could end in varily,    anyway. But I choose this, a sweet one. I wish time finds you well, meeting you with some girl who actually deserves you and love you. I wish you speedy move on. You deserve it, dear, you don't deserve someone damaged like me. Love you to the moon and back."
