A friend of mine posted healthcheck result. Pretty healthy, except for knee parts. It reveals meniscus tear, a severe one.

That is devastating. We both know that we love the sport so much - weightlifting - and it requires healthy joints to grow. Doctor advised to not continue the hobby, and suggest something less joint-taxing instead. He has achieved quite good numbers on his lift, that's unfortunate to receive such news.

That might be the end of it. The end of the journey. Still do not know the decision yet - whether rehab or *sayonara*. But one thing for sure: farewell to something you really keen for is shaking *your ground* quite hard. Even for just a while.

Injuries are common, and people takes them differently. Some just retire their shoes and reminiscing good old days, other people took the long journey of rehab hoping injured parts will heal and returns to platform, stronger. Some of them even suffers several injuries, in different times, and different parts. And some of them, went back to platform after several rehabs.

For the record, rehab is strenuous. Even for a single injury, the amount of work required is tremendous. Let alone several injuries. All for returning to the platform, feeling the good adrenaline pump of getting white lights from juries.    

And that, what makes them awesome. Their grit are supreme.

God bless, pal! Platform will miss you!
