Folks!

Wishing you well despite this pandemic situation happening.

I'm just a little tiny bit disturbed about trend of self cooking nowadays - everyone seems to put all they have into a blender and cook them in the oven, eat them, etc.

My friend once put oreos, butter, sweet milk (which is not even a milk), sugar, choco powder. The only natural and has no sugar in it was cocoa. She called it `choco smoothies`.

It should be `diabetes emulsion`.

You bet - it's extremely sweet that I got diabetes just by watching it.

We all know that our jeans may not fit us anymore after the pandemic is over, but for sweet mother of Alabama, don't eat all the sugar in just one sitting. You may not corona-positive, but you may got diabetes-positive.

Well, that's none of my business anyway, stuffs you put into your plate.
