A: I actually want to say something.

B: ok, I'm listening

A: (*sigh*) ah nevermind, it just a random wind in my head

B: ah, come on. spit it out.

A: no, nevermind. it's minute.

B: ok, just bury it in secret to the grave

A: yap

B: yes, let it took part in your mind forever and let that small thought consume that space til the day you die

A: ok

B: you know, in trial, if you happened to know things that could have prevent the crime and chose to stay silent, you will get charged as well - despite you didn't do the deed.

A: you're good are this, aren't you?

B: your opinion matters to me, I value them a lot. but yea, to know something and choose not to tell, is also a crime.

B: ok ok I'll tell. I'm afraid you'll get lost.

A: how come?

B: (*explains*)

A: haaaaa I see. well, I've prepared tho - it happened once but I'll do my best to avoid it.

B: yap, I know. that's why I said it's minute. I only saw them and that comes to my mind

A: no, your opinion matters to me. But, I'm *that* good, aren't I? *Hehe*

B: yeaaaa

A: thanks for your concern by the way, glad to know that you care. don't hesitate telling me anything, will you? I will listen with all ears in this world

B: fosho!
