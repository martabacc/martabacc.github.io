A: I actually want to say something.

B: OK, I'm listening

A: (*sigh*) Ah nevermind, it just a random wind in my head

B: ah, come on. spit it out.

A: No, nevermind. It's minute.

B: OK, just bury it in secret to the grave

A: yap

B: yes, let it took a part in your mind forever and let that small thought consume that space til the day you die

A: ok

B: come on, I need second opinion. You know, in trial, if you happened to know things that could have prevent the crime and chose to stay silent, you will get charged as well - despite you didn't do the deed.

A: you always know how to dig information, don't you?

B: your opinion matters to me, I value them a lot.

A: to know something and choose not to tell, is also a crime.

B: ok ok I'll tell. I'm afraid you'll get lost.

A: how come?

B: the pictures!

A: haaaaa I see. But I've guard it well. Let's hope it won't break soon. I lost it once, but this time I won't lose them again.

B: yap, I know. that's why I said it is trivia. I only saw them and that comes to my mind.

A: I'm that good, aren't I? (*smiles*)

B: Yeaaaaaaaaaa

A: Thanks for your consideration, I highly appreciate them. Kindly tell me if you have something to tell, will you?

B: sure
