title: first property and hopes
--- 

There are three things I fond in this world: code, treasury (*memutar uang*), and psychology.

I found a new and interesting apartment around Serpong. It is small, indent yet (marketer said it should be ready at early 2021), and I cannot be more excited.

Crunched number here and there, calculating capital gain around 30% on it pessimist forecast and without renting them for five years (ann 6%). Of course I'm interested in renting them so I got two streams of income (property gain and rent charge). Secured *force majeure* stuffs under insurance (let them do their best) (gonna make sure it's mentioned in the legal letter tho).

I'm gambling right here (*but who doesn't?*) - whether the IT industry will slow down on next three years (didn't choose bank mortgage - I cannot take the reality of me struck in debt for that long of years). Hence the amount I paid monthly is quite large, but it only lasts for three years and total amount I paid in the end is around 25% smaller compared to 15year mortgage option (diff is >100mio).

Well I understand, loan is a huge business with adequate risk so bank put them risks into pricing (I'm a banking person myself).

I cannot be more overwhelmed - first prop, first mortgage. For the first time, the thought of getting more income is surging - still got savings but that doesn't draw the safe line. Everything could happen nowadays.

Thinking about starting a small business (reselling or online shop), trading, taking side projects (along with my full plate from office heu), hasn't pick one yet.

Have a good day peeps!
