Second article of the day.

Somehow the thought of stay instead of working abroad occurs frequently - and my mind curious how much it would costs. So I did the homework.

Grabbed my calculator, scoured Google about the options and noted lowest and highest limit. Inserting my lowest earnings and forecasting of investment interests with lowest gain (*didn't put negatives in equation, hoping economy go well for the next decade*).

I can't believe what I saw - the discrepancy is uncanny. Apparently establishing ground in metropole is much more than I thought. Well, I never thought of it, (*obviously, it was an exit plan and it's a stay plan*) but I do not expect it would be that high.

Even after I put optimistic future yield and prosperous returns, it is still a long journey to the goal.

I can feel my breath getting heavier as I write every single word in this post.

*C'est la vie*.
