Hi, I just want you to know that this morning while I was having entangled discussion in a huddle, my brain decided it is a good time to build a reverie of you and reliving the moment of your crispy chuckle. Those crescented eyes.


TLDR: out of the blue I thought of you during this morning's meeting.
