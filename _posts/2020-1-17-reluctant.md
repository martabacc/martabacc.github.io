she can say that mom and dad is not having the best of what marriage can give. maybe they're having the worst?

earliest time she aware of the chaos is when she was five - an innocent kindergarten student is coming to school after watched her parents arguing during breakfast. and came home to the same wreck.

she watched the spectacular show (of them fighting) everyday. relentless arguments with no light shed upon what's argued is her normal day.

no, the fight is not entirely physical. mom and dad spat endless emotional assaults to each other. sometimes plates and kitchenwares involved, however those are not the only thing who took the damage.

it was their daughter.

their contempts of each other, assaults, arguments - built a narrative in her head - do not trust somebody too much. you might end up living your live like them.

she grown up thinking that marriage is an awful concept. marriage translates into a situation where you trapped with someone who could change everytime and nothing you can do about it. mom always told me that dad changed, also the same thing with dad. ok we get it, you both changed.

then time past by. fast forward to 24 year old version of her.

feelings come past and by. not a real charmer, but she managed to get involved into several relationships.

but there's a catch here. everytime she got into someone comfortable enough, she realized it could be the trap. the trap her parent fell when they were young.

when her partner suggesting to step the relationship forward, imagery of her parents fighting plays on her mind like a broken tv. past strifes take over her mind. she become terrified. the panic, the trauma.

the face of her father throwing plates now changes into him. the shouts, name-calling, now plays with his voice. her mother's whimper now take place in her lungs. all painful memories of her youth.

nope. time to flight. she set boundaries, be distant, pulling herself off of everything related with it. regardless what she really felt, fear is all she envisioned.

she never have forward visions of every relationship she had. and may never will. the narrative of awful marriage, being locked with someone who can change everytime, terrifies her.
