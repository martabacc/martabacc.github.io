I think I have posted regarding fortune around two posts in a row (?) well you bet, here it comes again.

I don't know whether I'm a lazy person, or maybe I'm just not good at selling. I start feeling bored, or I just not have much time. Or my time management is just not right.

If I am lost on an island and the only way I get out from there is to sell something, I'll be stranded there forever (hahaha). No luck, maybe.

I felt like trading is not in my blood. Both my parents are regular employees, they don't speak sales during dinner. They speaks which restaurant's good, that watermelon's price stonks. Regular convo.

But, we're not going this far to go this far, right?

I started thinking of other stream rather then selling, let's say, making goods and excelling the quality. Because I know for a fact - that I'm good at excelling. It only need two variable: time and resources.

The million dollar question is: how to do it in (considerable) shortest time, fewest resources, and yield biggest gain.

making your own wheel of fortune is hard, when you don't have one to begin with. but that doesn't mean it is impossible,right? (*wink*)
