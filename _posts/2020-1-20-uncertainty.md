A chill wind during one calm afternoon - caressing my cheeks lightly and walking me through the delightful nuance.

My eyes slips through your charcoal hair along with tangerine shades gifted by the sunset. Wondering how it would feels if my fingers take their turns.

My eyes stroll through remnant eye of yours - crescent-shaped as you chuckled. It's a very slow walk, doing its very best so nothing left behind.

<!-- The journey continues to your laughter - those blissful and crispy laugh. Not once my lips rapture the imagination of them devoring yours.

Relishing the imagination of my hands discovering all the wonders you brought to this world. Jesus, how come I didn't find him sooner? What took it so long? -->

My mind exerts the reality that I may have slipped off. The defense mechanism built for years triggered the alarm - let's step off and consider the worst, it said.

It could be a lie, it said. It could tore you apart _again_ like last time, it said.

But I choose to disregard the signal for once. All my senses are one in favor - savoring every moment presents in front of me here while it lasts.
