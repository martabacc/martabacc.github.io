title: Emotionally Available
---


Ramayana is one famous saga and here told in Wayang shows. It comes with classic plot: Rama as protagonist, Sita as central female character and Ravana as the antagonist.

I read it from a thick book with black cover with huge title 'Ravana'.

In contrast to public knowledge, it narrates Ravana as protagonist, someone with tragedies as his past and committed to do good deed for the rest of his life.

During one of his war, he was intrigued into kidnapping Sita, Rama’s wife. Ravana respected Rama after all, so he treated her gently and ultimately fell in love with her. He treated her like a queen of his kingdom.

The book mentioned that Sita was touched by Ravana’s kindness towards her, despite her refusal and chose to maintain her chastity.

In vengeance, Rama declared war - resulted Ravana’s tragic defeat and Rama’s glorious victory.

Despite the victory, Sita did not happen to live happily ever after with her husband. 

She got exiled twice. First, Ayodhyas (Rama's people) doubted Sita's purity (that she had lived with a man other than her husband), to which she proved by stayed alive after walked on stones of fire. The second exile due to her childhood curse.

On Friday a colleague stopped at my desk and took a seat beside me.

"I'm looking for a company", he said. "My team is having a gathering and I don't feel like it"

"Why is that?" I replied.
 
*"I don't know, I just don't feel like it"*

"Are you trying to distance yourself? What's wrong with them?"

"No, nothing's wrong", he answered.

"Have you try to be *emotionally available?* Being actually present?"  
  
He muttered something inaudible.

"You'll always feel distant if you're not open to what they bring to the table", I continued.

Followed by silence for a time.

*"I guess for now I choose not to..."*

First time I heard the term of emotionally available, I thought it’s made up by some hippie folks to explain something unimportant.

*But it is a thing, indeed.*

If my colleague decided to be open and being present, maybe he'll enjoy the team's gathering instead and not seeking for another company. It's the elephant of the room - that gathering is the very solution of his problem.

If Sita was emotionally available, embracing all the Ravana's kind advances, history would give us completely different story: Good deed and faith changed queen’s heart. Ravana might won the war. Sita could have ended having the best of her life with a beast who repent and fall onto his knees for a love he won.


No matter how much the world shuffles and revolves around you, you will not change - if you are not present. Even if you are physically there - no use if your mind wanders somewhere else.
