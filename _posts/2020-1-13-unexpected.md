title: Unexpected

Office matters getting hectic nowadays, that I decided to pull out from gym life and prioritize the office errands.

Adjusting the habit of being active to more sedentary one. Life goes on. To substitute, I choose running.

I have anticipate that there will be some weight loss, as when you stops strength training, water leaves your muscle and losing power, resulting in losing body weight in general. And cardio makes it worse.

And yes, it happened. But the thing is, the number is declining in an alarming rate. For the record, I was 61 at December 31. It touched 56 at January 12.

I'm disheartened. I admit that I neglected nutritions (due to stress, no appetite), rarely eats, extra shot americano three times daily, lack of quality sleep.

I wake up with no energy, exhausted. Spending the day feverish, dizzy, and tired.

This one is the worst. Ever.

Hope I can get this under control shortly. If this continues, it may touches 50 in no time - and also me arrives at nearby hospital.
