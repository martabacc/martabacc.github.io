For a year-standard, 2020 is like preadolescence. Kinda messy. Chaotic.

2020 is an impulsive spinning wheel, dispatch unpredictably and then slows down that lazy turtle could win the race.

Covid-19 is all over the place. No, actually it's all over everyone's head.

It switched off most of day-to-day essentials. Social interaction's on hiatus,   to bare minimum.

Feels weird, strange. Of course the same meaning can be conveyed without those aspects - but it feels ... less.

Can't hang out with friends, having fries as commuting's too risky. Can't have casual run because favorite track's closed. Can't go to gym for the same reason. Hesitant meeting people. Fearing to go to local shop nearby, might get infected there.

Timing can't be more perfect. I have more spare time now, office get less chaotic, and then this. Destiny is one awkward lame guy.

Suffocating, is the correct word for this. Anxiety strangles, cannot breathe. As someone who cannot stand monotony, it's tough. Well, I usually deal with this kinda emotion with exercising. But due to the outbreak I can't do it the way I like it, gotta find another alternative before I find myself died and bored.

This is hard. Good thing is, this is temporary. Aight, another delayed-gratification stuff, I get it. Patience, restraint, moderation, for greater good, yadda yadda. Oh clock please just tick faster - it becomes heavier for every second of you.

**However, regardless the boredom - I'll learn something new. Appreciating more of future interactions, as I have known the suffer of lacking one. Apparently took them for granted, and I'll be more grateful from now on.**        

Cheers all, Godspeed this Covid-19 thing.

ps: here is a lovely dog staring at you, for the warmth of your hearth. It also happen as my wallpaper, for warming mine!
