title: No Regret

About a year before, we were adamant that _this_ was the best option. We disdained the idea of moving out - considering it has zero benefit compared to what we were having at the time.

But table has turned. Future is always unexpected and its unforeseen nature is giving us chills.

Frankly, we should have seen this happen. We are participant - we saw everything. We should have predicted what comes next, as the audience of company's evolution - its strategy and everything.

But the damage has been done. We cannot pull out, it's too late.

People who are out (or luckily have no choice other than move out) that time are spitting sarcastic things now - _'do you enjoy your choice now?'_. Well, I cannot say that I do.

_However..._

This is not a bad move at all. We learned so much during the nerve-racking process, lessons that can only be learned with high pressure. Things we may not encounter if we choose to move to other easier project.

Leaving comfortable zone is always hard. We resent the idea of sacrificing.

We put so much effort on what we're doing now, and our only hope is having the product released (should be by next month). I can say everything in this world but it would still understate the efforts. Sleepless nights, working weekends, strange bugs, puzzling answers we seek... But them all taught us everything. Everything we need to level up, then we move out (;
