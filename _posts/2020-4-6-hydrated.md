Hello April!

Also welcoming new problem of my face skin: dehydration.

Two days after moving, I noticed medium breakouts on my face. I thought it's just period acnes, so I didn't take it seriously.

But no, it continued that several days after I saw myself at the mirror and regretted it.

Apparently it's due to the air conditioning in this new place - I never had a conditioned room before (*ftr when I was at Surabaya, I lived 4 years there without ac, and for the next 2 years at Jakarta*). I never used to use much hydrating emulsion on my face - because it suits the weather.

But I learned that in conditioned room (like mine now), my face cannot supply enough natural moisture that it triggered breakouts and acnes. I didn't feel my face really dry, hence I didn't notice.

Been a week applying extensive amount of these products on my regime, and breakouts are diminishing.

Haha, never thought of this before I decided to move. Because, like, hydrating  products are pricey (good ones started at $10) (TâŒ“T) should I start worring the moisture of my wallet now? Hahahahahaha.


Now I know, now you know \*wink\*. Drink your water, folks!
