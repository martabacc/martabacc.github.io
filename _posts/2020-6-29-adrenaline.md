Been a month since switched from long-term investment into short-period trader.

To be honest, it is an extreme sport. Walks you through wheel of emotions. One time brings you to despair, and another time bursts you with joy and triumph when they go up.

Such game of adrenaline.

One time it go down, and I forgot to cut loss - I had to pivot how to minimize the risk. Average down, or just wait  for some time until it raises again. I hate the latter option.

One time it go up, and I still wait for it to go up, and it didn't and instead it dropped, I regret why I didn't sell it sooner.

At the end - it's just shares. It's just electronic paper and has a value, and nothing else. It is done when you involve emotion, greediness, impatience within this game.

I'm thinking to put more into this bag, allocating more on this investment. Planning to at least having 100mio as capital to trading, looking around 1-2years for this aim :p see you on the other side!
