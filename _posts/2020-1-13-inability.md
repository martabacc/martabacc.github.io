Imagine you're standing in a road. There's a long road ahead, but from the beginning you have known that  you won't reach the destination. Not because you can't, but you won't.

You just want to have fun. You like to take a walk. You like to see the scenery around.

And it _always_ happen. Until it makes you lost the sense of _arriving_. You're always departing.

Then there's this one road. It's very pretty, chill wind, sunny and enough warmth that makes you keeps walking. Unlike other roads you've been before, this road is _induling_ another part of you. Makes you stay doing what you're doing.

And then you walk, you walk, then you realize. You're about to arrive.

Then the panic starts kicking in. Inability to predict the future, where will this ends?

Getting agitated, but the journey is comforting. It's like mixed feelings, both fear, worry, but also joy, comfortable.
