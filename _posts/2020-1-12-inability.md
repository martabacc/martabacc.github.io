Imagine a highway with a lot of roads. Long ones, and from the beginning you know that you won't reach the destination. Not because you can't, but because you won't.

You like to take a walk. You like to see the scenery around. 

Taking some good time to walk some roads, enjoy the view, see the birds chirping and trees waving, then move to another.

It _always_ happens. It makes you _lost the sense of arriving_. You're always departing.

Then there's this one road. It's very pretty, chill wind, sunny and enough warmth that makes you keep walking. Unlike other roads you've been before, this road is _indulging_ another part of you. Makes you stay doing what you're doing.

You continue to walk until you realize - you're about to arrive.

The panic starts kicking in. Inability to predict the future. Where will this ends?

Getting agitated - and on the other hand - the journey is comforting. It's like mixed feelings, both fear, worry, but also joy, comfortable.
