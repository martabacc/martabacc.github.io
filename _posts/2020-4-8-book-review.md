title: Book Review
--- 

<- been coding for the whole day. So I take a breath outside of my dark monitor, and find something to write out.

Ah ok, so I'm about to tell you six books notable for me for the last ten years. I'm an avid reader. Fun thing is, it can tell you so much about a person. So do guess, what kind of person I am? ;p

I divide the review into two - most difficult books and books that changed me.

## Most Difficult Books

I put them here for various and distinctive reasons - each of them are unique. Could be words used are too heavy and hard to digest, or the content is just _not me_ at all.

### 1. Social Intelligence - Daniel Goleman

> Bought: three years ago  
> Language: Bahasa

This book has been around for years, and we've been friends since. We didn't get along on first year, it's stubborn and content with difficult terms that's not easily digested. I have to pause around five minutes (at minimum), grasp the idea before moving to next paragraph.

Regardless, this book is super insightful. It's hard to read (it challenges your concentration, very compact), but it teach me to read _slowly_. I enjoy this book personally, but it's not a light read. It's not kind of book you want to read during lunch, but it's the one if you have long commuting with piano music on your headset - or you're an early riser and need accompany with your morning coffee.

### 2. The Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham

> Bought: four years ago  
> Language: Bahasa

I remember the excitement when I went to Gramedia Matraman, a day after stocks seminar - as they highly recommend this book. They endorse it with starry and round eyes, made me wondering how could papers bundled with glue made someone as _high_ as that.

On the contrary, I do not find that much excitement on first chapter. I may bought the newer version that it has so much reviews, overshadowing the real content that Graham want to convey.

I'll tell you a secret, I haven't made it to second chapter yet.

### 3. A Return to Love - Marianne Williamson

> Bought: three years ago  
> Language: Bahasa

This hidden gem I found on Big Black Wolf, three years ago.

No, it's not a knowledge book. I personally enjoy its first two chapters, but I read the third's title, I paused. Even its preface  made me hesitate to continue, but I did anyway. And I did stop on page three.

No, it's as much insightful as Goleman's. This kinda book is read with heart, you feel every word it writes. You feel the emotion, as they stream from your eyes to your mind.

But third chapter stop the stream, idk why. Maybe that topic is not my cup of coffee.

## Life-changing Books

### 1. Body Language - Glenn Willson

> Bought: three years ago  
> I've read it for: 7 times

If there's a most insightful and lightest read - this book has been awarded ten times. It tells me exactly things I need to know and easy to comprehend.

I bought it with low price at BBW three years ago (same cart with Williamson's Return to Love), and I did not regret every single penny I spent on it. It also includes easy social experiments to prove its points. I never found a book that's so true, yet so light. I can see and do them in every interactions I have.


### 2. Rahwana - Anand Neelakantan

> Bought: three years ago  
> I've read it for: 3 times

It's the only fiction-genre in this list. I'm not a big fan of sagas especially _menye-menye_ ones (remember Rama-Sinta tale?). However, this book tells me a completely different story - seeing the world as a villain. It potrays Rahwana - the monstrous creatures - as someone with heart and try his best to do anything. He just want to be someone, but everyone around him labeled him differently.

Well, this books teach me another point of view of being antagonist when _you're not_. Regardless it's true or not (it's a tale anyway), but I got the point. How hard it is to fight when the world rejects.

_Hint hint_, it's not a happy ending.

### 3. Analects of Confucius

> Bought: ten years ago  
> I've read it for: 15+ times (I lost count)    

Well, this is a book I tell everyone as a must read. It's light, but it's hard to read (if you choose not to). It's like filling a cup, spills if you do not empty it first. So does your mind.

Long story short, it tells you _why_, fundamentally, you have to be kind without any superpower, religion-related reasons.

I denied it first. First time I finished it, I put it back to my book gallery and let it sit for months. But months later, somehow my mind seek the wisdom it wrote (again). And, you bet, it repeated. And repeated. I lost count.

History repeats itself, isn't it?

## Honorable Mention

### The Innovators - Walter Isaacson

> Bought: 12? years ago  
> I've read it for: 2 times

Isaacson is a wonderful writer. He can put words about inventors, spinning emotions, stir our feelings but felt like a winner just like the inventors succeed. He express it beautifully.

It mentions Ada Lovelace as Computer Science's inventor (I read it before I enter college). Hey, I'm an engineer now. Can't be more proud!
