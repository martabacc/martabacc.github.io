title: Pandora's Delight
---

It is a delight for me to find myself mystified. 

Like the enjoyment when I find good food in somewhere fortuitous, and they actually worth it. 

When they donâ€™t serve their looks, eye is gullible.

The spices, they fulfill each other. I sink myself in the flavor, astonished of their perfect combination, as they arrives in my taste buds.

Hold your horses, as there's more of it.

**Yes, there's more of it!** It comes when I try to make the same one at my kitchen. Replicating what Iâ€™ve tasted before. The triumph when I did it, send chills down the spine even though it's just a small accomplice. *My little food laboratory.*

**Anticipating the unknowns, the delight of Pandora.**

Reading is also one of my greatest source of satisfaction. Especially the one with plot twists. Brief clues and let the readers do the rest - skim the nuance, the situation, stirs emotions in cadence.

Finding yourself lost in writerâ€™s imagination.

Letting it leads to the wrong end when it actually advances otherwise.

Loathing yourself in thoughts of where this part will ends.

Will it ever ends?

Captured in writerâ€™s trap, confused in conclusions.

Enlightened by the last chapter and realizing you have been misled all the time.

  
Unlike food, it never came to me to do my own writing. 

To design a maze of mind, to enchant people with words. Building tension that plays with people. Getting them captived by their own speculations. Eventually surprise them in the end as a reward for following the trails.

Well it has come now ðŸ™ƒ. Been looking for inspiration, now my drafts are piling.

Will the â€˜*more of itâ€™* feeling comes when I write my own, just like what I did in my little food lab?

Guess I'll find out very soon!

Wish me luck!
