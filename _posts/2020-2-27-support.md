This morning, I woke up and weary. Worn out, knowing that I'm gonna exhaust myself again today (there's a critical issue in the office) and felt extremely helpless. I've never felt so tired before.

Suddenly I lost my shit, and broke to tears.

I fell into deep agony for an hour long, and the pain didn't go away (usually it diminishes after I weep for some time, and this time it didn't). I realized I couldn't hold it anymore, I grabbed my phone. I need to talk about this and let it out.

Scrolled my recent contacts and there was mom. Mom came to rescue.

Despite my difficulty speaking, my mom did her best to calm me down. I was sobbing deeply for our entire conversation.

After some time, when I finally able gathered my shits (it went for about two hours), my phone rang. It was dad.

He comforted me, with some professional advice (*hahaha daddy things*). I would laugh if I could (*he's kinda awkward on expressing his feelings but he is indeed a loving and caring dad*) but I couldn't speak (blocked nose from crying), difficulty breathing and headache. After some time, I thanked him briefly and disconnected the call.

I never felt so helpless - last time was after university admission test that I failed seven/eight years ago. And now it's worse. Weeping and sobbing so hard - I can feel my lung is racing to supply breath as my weep is getting harder.

Actually I'm aware of what happened. I know what made me felt into so much grieve.

The idea of me being helpless and incapable, not able to manage things, cannot be trusted, tore me apart. My heart cannot handle the fact that - if at the end of all this, I cannot handle it well - it means I'm not enough. I'm worthless - and that really suffocate my heart, knowing that myself is valued less. I'm seeing myself as loser and not worthy of anything in this world, including self-love - and that is the kind of thing I'd avoid and willing to sell my soul for.

This feeling defeats me so bad - and throw me to the bottom of my sanity (I cannot think of anything during this period), everytime it came. Helplessness is something I can never deal gracefully with.

Fortunately, after lunch the particular issue that has been bugging my sleep and consciousness for weeks, has been resolved. Discussed with my coworker *and it's actually not a problem, for now*. HOAH! My eyes were opened, my lung were back and I could laugh again - finally I can breath lightly, felt so relieved.

I decided to inform mom and dad regarding this, they seems worried from their texts. They need to know that I'm okay now.

*\*marboru means having daughter(s), but it implies more touchy feeling as Bataknese father are really fond of their daughter(s) as it was described in Bataknese's songs and folklores. Or maybe dad's taking care for his only daughter seriously, could be my dad's things\**

Felt like my heart melted.... They're really supportive. I was worried about my capability and they worried about me... I can never love you as much the way you deserved to be loved, dad and mom... I can give you all the love in this world and it'll still not enough to return the favor.

ps: my concealer did a great job today on hiding my sobbing face. Before I wear them I looked to the mirror and saw a ghost
