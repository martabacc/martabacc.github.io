### An engineer who lives in Jakarta for another year.

Never thougt I'll ended up being engineery and all its stuff, but I really love what I do now. It suits me so much so it never comes to me that I'm actually working the entire day.

Also I have a keen interest on strength training. You may see some of my writings here regarding those topics. Since it's been only a year, I'm still a greenie in the field, but I'm eager to learn about it. *Yea, it's that addicting*.

I'd like to describe my strength ability, in general, as *lack of natural ability but tries hard.*
